Questions

Question 1:
	Using AlloyUI, how would you make all the list items in a page have a green background?

-Answer 
	<script>
		YUI().use(
			'node',
			function(Y) {
				var foo = Y.all('li');
				foo.setStyles(
					{
						backgroundColor: 'green'
					}
				);
			}
		);
	</script>

Question 2:
	What is missing from this page to prevent AlloyUI's form-validator from working?
	<!doctype html>
	<html>
		<head></head>
		<body>
			<div>
				<h1>There's plenty of room in Texas, you know?</h1>
				<input class="field-required" name="text" placeholder="Insert your clever reply here." style="width: 80%" type="text"/>
				<br />
				<input class="btn" type="submit" value="Booyah!" />
			</div>
		</body>
	</html>

-Answer
	Standard practice says that the <head> portion should have links to Alloy UI's script bases. Remember these?:
		<script src="http://cdn.alloyui.com/2.0.0/aui/aui-min.js"></script>
		<link href="http://cdn.alloyui.com/2.0.0/aui-css/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"></link>
	Also <form> is needed before the input areas which are to be validated.

Question 3:
	How do you make use of a module's method?

-Answer
	Use dot notation, for example: within the 'node' module, if you have  "var foo = Y.one('selector');" you can use the node module of setHTML by writing it like this: foo.setHTML(<string or otherwise in put here>)

Question 4:
	What does AJAX stand for and how is it used?

-Answer
	AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is used to exchange information between server and client without requiring a page to be refreshed/reloaded. On-demand information pulling/pushing. For further information, here's the wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)

Question 5:
	What two characters aren't allowed in JSON structures (except with qualifiers)?

-Answer
	\ and "
	To properly use these you must preface them with a '\'. Some ways to write special characters also necessitate using the \ such as \n for newline, \r for a return and \t for tab. More information on json notation and formats can be found at http://json.org

Question 6:
	What is a resource you can check to see how an AUI module works?

-Answer
	Check at http://alloyui.com/api/  This is the go-to place for reading both modules and classes handled by AlloyUI. Requires an understanding of "methods" "properties" and "events". Much of the information is DOM related.

Question 7:
	What is the difference between "Y.Node.create('<div />')" and "node.setHTML('<div />')"

-Answer
	The first "Y.Node.create('<div />')" is for creating a new code, and is usually assigned to a variable. 
	e.g. var node = Y.Node.create('<div />') 
	whereas node.setHTML('<div />') is for setting HTML code to something, it will overwrite whatever is there previously! A A good two hit combo in the 'node' module is first creating, then filling in with the .setHTML().
